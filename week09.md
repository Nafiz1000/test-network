## Task 2. Select Security Objectives 

The following is the importance of the attack/vulnerability it may mitigate. 

1. Function: Protect; Category: Access Control; Sub-category: Identity Management (IDAM)

Objective:
Ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the network and sensitive data through effective Identity and Access Management (IDAM).
Importance of the Project:
Effective IDAM is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with the project's network resources.
Mitigated Attack/Vulnerability:
Mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches due to compromised or unauthorized credentials.

2. Function: Protect; Category: Data Security; Sub-category: Data Protection (Encryption)

Objective:
Implement encryption mechanisms to protect data both in transit and at rest, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
Importance of the Project:
Data protection through encryption is essential for safeguarding customer and financial data stored and transmitted within the project's network.
Mitigated Attack/Vulnerability:
Mitigates the risk of data interception and unauthorized access, especially during data transmission and storage, enhancing overall data security.


3. Function: Detect; Category: Anomalies and Events; Sub-category: Anomalous Patterns (Behavioral Analytics)

Objective:
Implement solutions for detecting abnormal patterns in network activity, leveraging behavioral analytics to identify deviations from normal behavior.
Importance of the Project:
Behavioral analytics enhance the ability to detect abnormal activities indicative of potential security incidents, providing a proactive approach to threat detection.
Mitigated Attack/Vulnerability:
It helps detect insider threats, unusual user behavior, or abnormal network patterns that may indicate a sophisticated attack or compromise.



4. Function: Detect; Category: Continuous Monitoring; Sub-category: Security Continuous Monitoring

Objective:
Establish continuous monitoring processes to detect and respond to security events promptly, reducing the time between the occurrence of an incident and its identification.
Importance of the Project:
Continuous monitoring ensures real-time visibility into the network, enabling swift response to security incidents and minimizing potential damages.
Mitigated Attack/Vulnerability:
Reduces attackers' dwell time within the network by quickly identifying and responding to security incidents, limiting the potential impact of advanced persistent threats.



## Task 3. Create Asset Inventory





For the following Data Assets Table:
Asset ID	Asset Type	Asset Description	Classification	Important Protections. The table is illustrated below,

For the Hardware Assets Table, Asset ID	Asset Type	Asset Description	Serial Number	Important Protections. The table is illustrated below,
