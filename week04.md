All adapters are generated by "Get-NetAdapter".

Every single detail of the routing table
Command, "Get_NetRoute-ifIndex 11", <br>

255.255.255.255/32  =   Broadcast address connected with one host. <br>
224.0.0.0/4       =    Multicast address identified for  one-to-many communication. <br>
10.162.35.255/32    =  Direct Broadcast address used for data transmission. <br>
10.162.32.65/22     =   Specific Host address of a system.<br>
10.162.32.0/22    =   Network address assigned the IP 10.162.35.61/32.<br>
10.162.32.1      =     Gateway IP address used for the communication.<br>




## Task 4. IP Network Design

Names of my team members are 

Nasrin Amin
ID: 12240095<br>
Manoj Kumar K C
ID : 12248791 <br>


a) IPv4 network addresses and assigning IP addresses to all devices. I have included a table 
listing  devices and assigned IPs. <br>
I have used the last four digits of my student ID for decimal values on LAN 1, and for  LAN 2, I have used my partner's ID. <br>

My student ID is 12240095. Since the last 4 digits of my id start with 00, I have replaced it with 11. So, it gives an IP of 11.95.0.0/24.
WAN and unknown values I have chosen randomly. 
My partner's IP is 12248791 which gives an IP of 87.91.0.0/24,
The IP Network Design.

c) The routing tables for every device are in the below tables, sequencing routing table by routing table 1, 2, 3, 4,<br>

d) If a host on one LAN sent an ICMP packet (e.g., ping request) to a host on the other LAN, and that 
packet was captured at a router. The addresses in the packet have been shown clearly.

If a host on one LAN sent an ICMP packet (e.g., ping request) to a host on the other LAN, and that 
packet was captured at a router, then draw the packet ICMP/IP. Indicate the addresses in 
the packet. MAC addresses would be in the Ethernet frame of the packet described here,

## Task 5. IP Address Lookup


After using the website "whatismy.com" to search for my IP, I learned a lot about it. It provides precise descriptions of every IP address. My location is also detected by the website.
138.77.214.61 is the IP address of IPv4, which I obtained from my university lab computer.
Melbourne, VIC AU is the IP address I'm using.

Central Queensland University is my ISP.<br>

The network provider of my home is a local IPv4 network provided by my local internet provider. IPv4 240.280.47.628 is the public IP address that I obtained from my home computer. 
Location of my IP: Sydney, NSW, AU <br>
Dodo Internet Pty Ltd is the ISP.<br>





## Task 6. IP Addresses, VPNs and Contract Cheating

a)Bypassing Geolocation Services with a VPN:

Access to Restricted Content: VPNs can help users access content that is geographically restricted, such as streaming services or websites limited to specific regions.
Enhanced Privacy: VPNs encrypt internet traffic, providing an additional layer of privacy and security, making it more challenging for third parties to monitor online activities.
Circumventing Censorship: In some countries, certain websites and services may be censored. A VPN can be used to bypass such censorship and access unrestricted information. 
Legal and Ethical Concerns: Bypassing geolocation services may violate terms of service agreements and, in some cases, be against the law.
 <br>

b) University Using IP Addresses to Identify Contract Cheating:
Monitoring Anomalies: Analyzing IP addresses can help identify patterns and anomalies in user behaviour, potentially flagging instances of multiple users accessing the same assignment or exam from different locations.
Privacy Concerns: Monitoring IP addresses raises privacy concerns as it involves tracking the online activities of individuals, which may be considered an invasion of privacy.
Shared Connections: IP addresses can be shared among multiple users, such as in dormitories or public spaces, leading to false positives and misidentifications.
Evasion Techniques: Students might use VPNs or other methods to mask their IP addresses, making it challenging to rely solely on this method for detecting contract cheating.<br>

c) Advice for Students Using a VPN in Australia:
Legal and Ethical Awareness: Understand the legal and ethical implications of using a VPN. Ensure that your usage complies with local laws and regulations.
Choose Reputable VPN Providers: Select a trustworthy VPN service that prioritizes user privacy and has a good reputation for security.
Consider University Policies: Be aware of your university's policies regarding VPN usage. Some institutions may have specific guidelines or restrictions.
Balancing Privacy and Responsibility: While VPNs offer privacy, use them responsibly. Avoid engaging in any activities that may violate academic integrity or legal standards.

Circumventing Censorship: In some countries, certain websites and services may be censored. A VPN can be used to bypass such censorship and access unrestricted information.
Security Risks: Using a VPN can introduce security risks, especially if the service is not reputable. Users should be cautious about potential data breaches and malicious activities.
Network Performance: VPNs can sometimes lead to slower internet speeds due to the added encryption and routing processes. <br>

 University Using IP Addresses to Identify Contract Cheating:

Monitoring Anomalies: Analyzing IP addresses can help identify patterns and anomalies in user behaviour, potentially flagging instances of multiple users accessing the same assignment or exam from different locations.
Deterrent Effect: The knowledge that IP addresses are monitored may act as a deterrent, discouraging students from engaging in contract cheating.
Privacy Concerns: Monitoring IP addresses raises privacy concerns as it involves tracking the online activities of individuals, which may be considered an invasion of privacy.
Shared Connections: IP addresses can be shared among multiple users, such as in dormitories or public spaces, leading to false positives and misidentifications. <br>
